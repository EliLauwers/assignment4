# About this document {-}

This document is the answer to the fourth databases assignment on database edit rules. The workflow for this assignment is as follows. 

# 1.Data exploration

Provide solutions to the following data exploration exercises related to the data in the `purpose` table (so not the example data given in Table 1) in your report.

1. Get the total number of rows.

**Answer**: There are 1511 rows in the `purpose` table 

```{bash}
echo -e "SELECT * FROM purpose" | java -jar rulebox.jar explore stats --d clinicaltrials.json
```

2. Get the total number of rows in which both attributes cst and dst take value ‘Interventional’.

**Answer**: There are 1284 where attributes cst and dst take value 'Interventional'

```{bash}
echo -e "SELECT * FROM purpose WHERE ctgov_study_type = 'Interventional' AND drks_study_type = 'Interventional'" | 
java -jar rulebox.jar explore stats --d clinicaltrials.json
```

3. Get the total number of rows in which the attributes cp and dp take equal, non-NULL values (so, different values with the same semantical meaning should not be considered equal). Make sure to check this in a case insensitive way.

**Answer**: There are 1205 such rows.

```{bash}
echo -e "SELECT * FROM purpose WHERE ctgov_purpose ilike drks_purpose AND ctgov_purpose IS NOT null" | 
java -jar rulebox.jar explore stats --d clinicaltrials.json
```

4. Get the total number of rows containing at least one NULL-value.

**Answer**: There are `r 61 + 186 + 11` (61 + 186 + 11) such rows

**Argumentation**: I find it a little bit easier to answer question 4 and 5 in one go, please see question 5 below for the answer.

5. Get the total number of rows containing at least two NULL-values.

**Answer**: There are `r 186 + 11` (186 + 11) such rows. 

**Argumentation**: I wrote an SQL query to get a count of null-values per row.

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT 
  sum_of_nulls
  , COUNT(*) number_of_rows
FROM (
	SELECT (
		(CASE WHEN ctgov_study_type IS null THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
		+ (CASE WHEN drks_study_type IS null THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
		+ (CASE WHEN study_type_non_interventional IS null THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
		+ (CASE WHEN observational_model IS null THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
		+ (CASE WHEN ctgov_purpose IS null THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
		+ (CASE WHEN drks_purpose IS null THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
		) sum_of_nulls
	FROM purpose
) sums
GROUP BY sum_of_nulls
ORDER BY sum_of_nulls asc 
```

6. Get, for each attribute, the total number of rows containing a NULL-value for the corresponding attribute.

**Answer**:

|Attribute|no. null values|
|---|---|
|study_type_non_interventional|1|
|ctgov_purpose|244|
|drks_purpose|209|
|drks_study_type|0|
|ctgov_study_type|0|
|observational_model|0|

```{bash}
echo -e "SELECT * FROM purpose" |
java -jar rulebox.jar explore stats --d clinicaltrials.json
```

# 2. Basic definitions
Provide answers to the following exercises in your report.

1. Explain in your own words the underlying meaning of edit rules

a) E3: For `cp`, there are 8 predefined study purposes ('Screening' + 7 other unique purposes). Rule E3 states that none of the 7 other purposes can be linked to the 'Screening' purpose for `dp`. So when `dp` takes a value of 'Screening', the `cp` must do so too.
b) E12: The `dst` attribute can take on two potential values. The `stni` attribute is used to further specify the 'non interventional' value for the `dst` attribute. When the `dst` attribute takes on the value of 'interventional', the `stni` should take on the value of 'N/A'. It means that a valid pattern is `cst`: Interventional, `dst`: Interventional, `stni`: N/A. Edit rule E12 makes this a bit more concrete. The rule states that whenever `cst` takes on a value of 'Interventional', the `stni` attribute cannot take on any other value than the value of 'N/A'.
c) E16: the `stni` and `om` attributes further specify observational studies (From the `cst` and `dst` attributes, we know that observational is equivalent to non-interventional). Edit rule E16 states that whenever the `stni` attribute indicates a interventional study instead of a non-interventional one, the `om` attribute should not indicate a further specification of an observational study. It does so by implying that `stni`:'N/A' can only be coupled with `om`:'N/A' and not with any of the 7 other specifications of observational studies.

2. List, for each of the following edit rules, which attributes are involved in the edit rule.

a) E1
b) E5
c) E14
d) E17

3. For each of the following sets of attributes, list those edit rules that involve all attributes in that set.

a) {stni}
b) {cp,dp}
c) {dst,om}
